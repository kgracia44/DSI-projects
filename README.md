# DSI-projects

### Hello to you!

Just some quick info about this repo you have found yourself in:

- I've recently completed a Data Science Immersive (DSI) Program at General Assembly.

- As part of the program curriculum, I was required to complete and submit a project each week (for 7 weeks). The aim for these projects was to apply machine learning and modeling techniques to explore problems in various fields and industries. 

- This repo contains those 7 weekly projects.

- I have an accompanying github blog post for each project where I explain in some detail what my intended attempt was, the bumps and successes along the way for each project, and the end results. If you are so inclined, check out my posts here: https://kgracia44.github.io/
